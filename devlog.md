This is project 2 which will simulate a bank environemnt. There are three tellers and the bank opens when all are ready. This will simulate how an actual bank environemnt will be.
From my initial understanding, I can see that this project will consist of a single file but with multiple threads at work to represent each teller and the customer. The output should then consist of detailing a log of the interactions and such. For this project, I plan to use python3 and make sure my script also works on the cs1 servers in python3. I am still rather confused about this project but I feel it is to implement deadlock prevention along with mainly talk about concurrecy, or have multiple processes work at the same time but not necessarily at the same time, so like a bank for example. This initial commit just details my thoughts so far. I will start working on adding some initial methods and such to my project and such.

This session I did not do much but really understand what the project was about so I feel like I have a good starting point. Next session, I look to really start writing out the logic by expanding the given example file to really add in additional teller and customer threads and utilize semaphores to facilitate communication between them.

So far, I understand that this project one requires one file which stores the customer and teller threads along with using semaphores to control which customer would get access and such so that is what the project mainly consists of.
This session I plan to setup the overall program when it comes to flow and just start by setting up the customer and teller threads and just set the project up. So I will look at the example code and then look to adjust that and understand where semaphores come into the overall project and how it works with the threads.

During my session, I wrote down the inital program which initializes three teller threads and 10 customer threads and adjusted the output. I am mainly focusing on figuring out how the semaphores work with the threading module and figuring out the flow. I did not encounter any major problems during this session so it fine overall. I accomplished my goal of getting an initial understanding of the flow using threads and sempahores, now I need to add the additional features that were required on the project. Next session, I plan to add those features.

So far, I made an initial flow where there are three teller threads and ten customer threads just for a demo right now. This work session, I am going to focus on adding more functionality that fits the requirements on the pdf and see how much I can get done.

This past working session, I mainly focused on adjusting my code to have two classes, one for the customers and another for the tellers. This is because each one stores states so having them as classes instead of methods is easier. I didn't really encounter many problems this working session. Next session, I plan on going through the pdf more and seeing what else I need to add and just work through the project like normal.
